                <h3>Message</h3>
                <p>It was the year 1991 Shri Narayan Das Agrawal decided to fulfil the dream of his father, Late Shri Ganeshi Lal Agrawal, of establishing an institute for quality education to the people and the region & beyond. and initiated Sri Jagannath Prasad Ganeshi Lal Bajaj Charitable Trust Samiti in an attempt to make the holy city Mathura a recognized destination for knowledge seekers from different spheres of life. This is what led to the foundation of a milestone at the karmabhoomi of the versatile and sagacious Lord Krishna. GLA has been actively involved with social causes since its very inception and has drawn appreciation from one and all for its works in various facets of societal paradigms.
